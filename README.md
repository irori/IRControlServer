# IRControlServer

This is an Android app that works as a HTTP server. You can POST [JSON formatted IR signal](http://getirkit.com/en/#section-5-JSON) to it to send IR signals via the device's headphone jack.

With an [infrared transmitter](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Infrared-transmitter-for-iPhone-iPod/) connected to the headphone jack, you can control electronic devices such as air conditioners through the network.
